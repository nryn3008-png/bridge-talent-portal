## 4. Competitive Positioning Map

```
              HIGH AUTOMATION / AI

          Consider ● | ● Getro
                     |
   RECRUITER/   _____|_______________  VC ADMIN
   SOURCING    |     |               |  FOCUSED
   FOCUSED     |     |               |

               |     |     ● Bridge  |
               |_____|_______________|
                     |
              HIGH COMMUNITY / ENGAGEMENT
```

**Getro:** High automation, VC admin-focused, zero community. A "set it and forget it" tool.

**Consider:** High automation + strong AI sourcing tools, serves VCs AND recruiters AND hiring companies. More active sourcing-oriented than Getro, but also zero community.

**Bridge:** Moderate automation (must improve), balanced across all users, high community engagement. The only platform where candidates actively participate.

---

## 5. What Consider Does That Getro Doesn't

Consider has several features that Getro lacks, making it a more serious competitor than it first appears:

1. **Gen AI Email Sequences** — Personalized outreach with automated follow-ups. Getro has no outreach tool; Consider turns the platform into an active recruiting engine, not just a passive job board.

2. **Talent Connections (network graph)** — Aggregates the entire organization's LinkedIn connections into one searchable interface, finding intro paths through colleagues. Getro does this via GetroConnect, but Consider integrates it more tightly.

3. **Slack App for Referrals** — Automatically collects referrals from Slack for open positions. This is a clever distribution mechanism that makes referrals frictionless.

4. **Chrome Extension** — One-click LinkedIn profile capture into projects/talent pools. This makes sourcing seamless for recruiters.

5. **Passive Interest** — Candidates can express interest in companies without applying to specific roles. This captures warmer leads that traditional "apply now" flows miss.

6. **Auto-notification to Portfolio Companies** — When new talent matches open roles, companies are notified automatically. Getro requires companies to actively search.

7. **Multi-audience Platform** — Consider serves VCs, hiring companies, AND staffing agencies. Getro is VC/EDO-focused.

8. **2-Way ATS Integrations** — Deep bidirectional integrations with Greenhouse, Lever, Salesforce. Getro's integrations are more limited.

9. **SOC 2 Type 2 + SSO** — Enterprise-grade security that Getro doesn't prominently advertise.

## 6. What Neither Getro NOR Consider Do (Bridge's Unique Space)

These are features that **only Bridge** plans to offer — making them the strongest differentiation points:

| Bridge-Only Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **Community Hub** (events, mentorship, messaging) | Keeps talent engaged between hiring cycles. Neither competitor has any community layer. |
| **Endorsement System** (VC/Founder/Peer badges) | Adds human trust signals to AI matching. Referred candidates convert 4x higher. |
| **Mentorship Matching** | Connects operators with rising talent, building long-term loyalty to the network. |
| **Skill Gap Analysis** | Shows VCs exactly what talent they have vs. what's needed — actionable intelligence. |
| **Diversity Metrics** | Accountability reporting that investors increasingly demand. |
| **Two-Way Feedback** | Candidates rate companies, companies rate candidates — improves match quality over time. |
| **Perks Portal Integration** | Cross-links hiring with portfolio benefits — "join this company AND get these perks." |
| **Compensation Transparency** | Salary/equity ranges + equity education attracts startup-savvy talent. |
| **Candidate Dashboard** | Personalized "Jobs For You," saved jobs, application tracking — a first-class candidate experience. |

---

## 7. Where Bridge MUST Catch Up (Table Stakes)

Based on analyzing both competitors, these features are now non-negotiable for Bridge:

### Critical (Phase 1 must-haves)

| Feature | Who Has It | Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Automatic job scraping from career pages & ATS | Both Getro & Consider | **P0** — Without this, Bridge is DOA |
| AI-powered candidate-to-job matching | Both | **P0** — Core functionality |
| Branded, filterable job board | Both | **P0** — Table stakes |
| Analytics / hire attribution | Both | **P0** — VCs need ROI proof |
| ATS integrations (Greenhouse, Lever, Salesforce) | Consider (2-way), Getro (limited) | **P1** — Must have by Phase 2 |

### Important (Phase 2)

| Feature | Who Has It | Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Auto-notification when talent matches jobs | Consider | **P1** — Removes friction for portfolio companies |
| Passive interest expression (without applying) | Consider | **P1** — Captures warmer leads |
| API access | Both | **P1** — VCs expect integration flexibility |
| SSO (SAML) | Consider | **P1** — Enterprise requirement |
| Contact/profile enrichment | Getro (via Findem) | **P2** — Nice to have |

### Nice-to-Have (Phase 3+)

| Feature | Who Has It | Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Gen AI email sequences | Consider | **P2** — Active outreach tool |
| Chrome extension for profile capture | Consider | **P2** — Recruiter workflow tool |
| Slack app for referral collection | Consider | **P2** — Frictionless referrals |
| Preferred job/company placement | Consider | **P3** — Monetization opportunity |
| Deal flow + sales intros | Both | **P3** — Expand beyond talent |
| Job trend reports | Getro | **P3** — Market intelligence |

## 8. Updated Strategic Recommendations for Bridge

### 8.1 Revised Phase 1 Scope

Based on competitive analysis, Phase 1 must now include:

**Original Phase 1 (keep all) PLUS:**
- ✅ Automatic job scraping (career pages + ATS connectors)
- ✅ Auto-notification to companies when talent matches their roles
- ✅ Passive interest expression ("I'm interested in this company" without applying)
- ✅ Basic analytics dashboard with hire attribution

### 8.2 Revised Phase 2 Scope

Add these to Phase 2:
- ✅ 2-way ATS integrations (Greenhouse, Lever, Salesforce, Ashby)
- ✅ SSO (SAML-based)
- ✅ API access for portfolio companies
- ✅ Slack integration for referral collection

### 8.3 Go-to-Market Positioning

**Against Getro:** "Getro automates your job board. Bridge builds your talent community. Your portfolio companies don't just need a list of candidates — they need a network of engaged, endorsed, pre-vetted talent who already know and trust your ecosystem."

**Against Consider:** "Consider is a powerful sourcing tool for recruiters. Bridge is a platform where talent comes to you — through community, events, mentorship, and referrals. Instead of hunting for candidates, build a network they actively want to join."

**Bridge's unique angle (vs. both):**
> "The only VC talent platform built for all three sides: candidates get a career community, portfolio companies get endorsed talent, and VCs get measurable network ROI — all in one integrated ecosystem alongside your existing Perks Portal."

### 8.4 Competitive Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Getro adds community features | LOW — Their architecture is tool-oriented, not platform-oriented. Would require major rebuild. | Move fast on community. First-mover advantage in VC talent communities. |
| Consider adds community features | LOW — Same. They're sourcing-focused. | Community requires fundamentally different product thinking. |
| Both have massive head start in automation | HIGH — Bridge needs solid automation from day one. | Don't reinvent the wheel — use existing ATS APIs and job scraping services. Focus engineering on community layer. |
| VC funds already committed to Getro/Consider | MEDIUM — Switching costs exist. | Offer migration tools + co-existence (run Bridge alongside existing tools). Lead with perks integration as the hook. |
| Consider's Gen AI outreach becomes industry standard | MEDIUM — If every VC expects AI outreach built-in. | Add Gen AI sequences in Phase 3. Partner with an AI outreach provider short-term. |

## 9. Three-Way Feature Comparison Summary

| Category | Getro | Consider | Bridge (Planned) | Winner |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Job aggregation & automation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ (needs work) | Getro |
| AI matching & suggestions | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Consider |
| Warm intros & network intelligence | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Getro |
| Active sourcing & outreach tools | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ | Consider |
| Talent profiles & directory | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Bridge** |
| Community & engagement | ⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Bridge** |
| Endorsements & social proof | ⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Bridge** |
| Candidate experience | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Bridge** |
| Analytics & ROI reporting | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Bridge** |
| ATS integrations | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ (planned) | Consider |
| Security & compliance | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Consider |
| Platform ecosystem | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Bridge** |
| Market adoption | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ (new) | Getro |

**Bridge wins 5 of 13 categories** — all in areas neither competitor addresses. The strategy is clear: match automation table stakes, then dominate on community, profiles, endorsements, candidate experience, and platform ecosystem.

---

## 10. Bottom Line

**Getro** is the market leader in VC job aggregation and warm intros — mature, well-adopted, but purely a back-office admin tool with zero community.

**Consider** is the more technically sophisticated competitor — Gen AI outreach, deep ATS integrations, Chrome extension, Slack referrals, multi-audience. But also zero community and weaker on the candidate side.

**Bridge** has the opportunity to be the first VC talent platform that's actually built for talent — not just for fund admins. Neither competitor has community features, endorsements, mentorship, or a candidate-facing experience worth talking about.

The winning formula: **Match Getro on automation (Phase 1), match Consider on integrations (Phase 2), then blow past both on community, endorsements, and candidate experience (Phase 2-3) — which neither can easily replicate.**
