## 4. What Getro Does Well

1. **Zero-maintenance job aggregation** — Daily automatic scraping from career pages means no manual work for the VC team or portfolio companies. This is their strongest selling point.

2. **Warm intro automation at scale** — The bi-directional intro engine with AI matching is sophisticated. It goes beyond talent and extends to deal flow and sales intros.

3. **Hire attribution tracking** — Full funnel from traffic → signup → application → hire, giving VCs provable ROI for LPs.

4. **Contact enrichment & intelligence** — Auto-updating contact data, knowing when people change roles, semantic search across the entire fund's network.

5. **Easy setup** — They emphasize "set up in minutes" — just provide company list and a URL, they do the rest.

6. **Broad market adoption** — 850+ networks, 875k+ monthly seekers. They have network effects and social proof.

## 5. What Getro Does NOT Do (Bridge's Opportunity)

### 5.1 No Community Layer

Getro has **zero community features**. No events, no messaging, no mentorship, no content hub. It's purely a job board + intros tool. Once a candidate applies or gets introduced, the relationship moves entirely off-platform.

**Bridge opportunity:** The Community Hub (events, mentorship, messaging, resources) is a massive differentiator. This keeps talent engaged between hiring cycles and builds long-term network value — something Getro completely lacks.

### 5.2 No Rich Talent Profiles

Getro captures candidates into a "talent network" via signup forms, but there are no rich, structured talent profiles. No portfolios, no skill tags, no availability status, no career preferences, no endorsements.

**Bridge opportunity:** Deep talent profiles with skills, portfolio, preferences, and endorsement badges create a LinkedIn-like layer purpose-built for the VC ecosystem. This makes the talent pool dramatically more useful for recruiters.

### 5.3 No Endorsement / Referral System

Getro has no social proof layer. No VC endorsements, no founder vouching, no peer referrals. The intros are AI-generated based on contact data, but there's no trust signal beyond "this person is in the database."

**Bridge opportunity:** The endorsement and referral system (VC badge, founder badge, peer endorsements) adds a human trust layer that AI alone can't replicate. Referred candidates convert 4x higher — this is a proven advantage.

### 5.4 No Candidate-Facing Experience

Getro is heavily fund/admin-facing. Job seekers see a branded job board and can sign up, but there's no personal dashboard, no "Jobs For You" matching, no application tracking from the candidate side, no career resources.

**Bridge opportunity:** A first-class candidate experience (personalized matches, application tracking, saved jobs, career resources) makes talent actually want to stay in the network. Getro treats candidates as passive data; Bridge can treat them as active community members.

### 5.5 No Skill Gap Analysis

Getro tracks what jobs are posted and who applies, but doesn't analyze the gap between what skills the talent pool has vs. what portfolio companies need.

**Bridge opportunity:** The skill supply/demand heatmap in the VC admin dashboard is unique in the market. Showing "your network has 200 React engineers but 0 Rust engineers — 12 roles need Rust" is actionable intelligence no competitor offers.

### 5.6 No Two-Way Feedback

Getro tracks outcomes (hired/not hired) but there's no mechanism for candidates to give feedback on companies or for companies to provide structured feedback on candidates.

**Bridge opportunity:** A two-way feedback loop improves match quality over time and gives candidates a reason to stay engaged.

### 5.7 No Compensation Transparency

Getro job listings don't emphasize salary/equity ranges. Candidates see basic role info but no comp benchmarking.

**Bridge opportunity:** Mandatory or encouraged salary/equity ranges (like Wellfound) plus startup equity education content would be a significant draw for talent.

### 5.8 Limited to Talent — No Perks Integration

Getro is a standalone product with no connection to other portfolio services. It doesn't know about perks, discounts, or other benefits the fund offers.

**Bridge opportunity:** Since Bridge already has the Perks Portal, cross-linking perks on job listings ("this company offers 30% off AWS through Bridge") adds unique value that reinforces the platform ecosystem.

## 6. Where Getro is Ahead (Bridge Needs to Match)

| Getro Strength | Risk for Bridge | Mitigation |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Automatic job scraping** — No manual work from portfolio companies | Bridge requires companies to post manually? That's a dealbreaker. | Must build or integrate a job scraper for career pages + ATS connectors from day one |
| **850+ networks, 875k seekers** — Massive network effects | Bridge starts at zero | Leverage existing Bridge network from Perks Portal; offer migration tools |
| **Findem acquisition** — Access to Findem's talent intelligence data | Bridge has no external data enrichment | Partner with a data enrichment provider (Clearbit, Apollo, People Data Labs) |
| **Dedicated account managers** — High-touch onboarding | Bridge is self-serve? | Offer white-glove setup for early adopters |
| **Deal flow + sales intros** — GetroConnect isn't just talent, it's a general network intro tool | Bridge spec is talent-only | Consider Phase 5: expand warm intros beyond talent to include deal flow and bizdev |
| **Zapier + API access** — Integration flexibility | Bridge has no integration story yet | Prioritize API and webhook support in Phase 2 |

## 7. Strategic Positioning

### Getro = Tool | Bridge = Platform

The fundamental difference: **Getro is a point solution** (job board + intros) while **Bridge is an ecosystem** (perks + talent + jobs + community).

Getro wins on automation and ease of setup for the narrow use case of "aggregate jobs and make intros." But it completely misses the bigger picture of building a living talent community.

### Bridge's Wedge

Bridge should NOT try to out-automate Getro on job scraping (match it, but don't lead with it). Instead, lead with the **community + candidate experience** angle:

> "Getro helps you post jobs. Bridge helps you build a talent community that makes every hire faster, every referral stronger, and every candidate a lifelong connection to your portfolio."

### Positioning Matrix

```
                    Automation ←————————————→ Community
                         |                       |
               Getro ●   |                       |
                         |                       |
                         |              ● Bridge
                         |                       |
              Fund-      |                       |
              focused ———|———————————————————————— Talent-
                         |                       focused
```

Getro = high automation, fund-focused, low community
Bridge = moderate automation, balanced for all users, high community

## 8. Recommended Adjustments to Bridge Spec

Based on this analysis, here are changes I'd recommend to the Bridge product spec:

### Must-Add (Critical gaps)

1. **Automatic job scraping** — Add this to Phase 1. Without it, portfolio companies won't adopt. Scrape from career pages, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby APIs.

2. **Bizdev/Sales intros** — GetroConnect's sales intro feature is heavily used. Consider expanding warm intros beyond talent to include revenue-generating intros for portfolio companies (Phase 3+).

3. **API & Zapier access** — Add to Phase 2. VCs expect integration flexibility.

### Should Strengthen (Competitive advantage)

4. **Lean harder into community** — This is Bridge's biggest differentiator. Make events, mentorship, and content a first-class part of the pitch, not a Phase 3 afterthought. Consider moving some community features to Phase 1.

5. **Candidate experience as a selling point** — Getro has almost no candidate-facing UX. Bridge should market the candidate dashboard, personalized matches, and career resources as reasons talent prefers Bridge networks.

6. **Endorsements front and center** — The trust layer (VC endorsements, founder badges) should be visible everywhere — on job listings, in search results, in email digests. This is something Getro simply cannot replicate.

### Nice-to-Have (Future differentiation)

7. **Alumni tracking** — Getro mentions auto-tracking when contacts change jobs. Bridge should consider this for Phase 4.

8. **Quarterly hiring reports** — Getro auto-generates these. Bridge should match this in the admin dashboard.

9. **Contact enrichment** — Partner with a data provider to auto-enrich talent profiles.

---

## 9. Bottom Line

Getro is a mature, well-adopted tool that does job aggregation and warm intros very well. But it's fundamentally a **back-office tool for VC platform teams** — candidates barely know it exists, and there's no community or relationship-building layer.

Bridge has the opportunity to build something bigger: a **talent ecosystem** where candidates actively want to be, companies get warm intros AND community engagement, and VCs get measurable ROI on a platform that does more than just list jobs.

The key risk is execution speed. Getro already has 850+ networks. Bridge needs to move fast on Phase 1, nail the automatic job scraping (table stakes), and then immediately differentiate with community features that Getro can't easily replicate.

*Next step: Finalize Bridge spec with these adjustments → Begin UI/UX design for Phase 1.*
